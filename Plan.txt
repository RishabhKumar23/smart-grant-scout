### 🚀 **7-Day Development Plan: Crypto Sentiment Trading Bot (Masa x MCP)**

#### **Day 1: Project Setup & Data Pipeline Kickoff**
- ✅ Set up GitHub repo (monorepo: `backend` in Python, `frontend` in Next.js).
- ✅ Define file structure and core packages (Poetry or pipenv for Python, Tailwind + TypeScript for Next.js).
- ✅ Initialize MCP client and scrape test sentiment data from **X** (via API or headless browser).
- ✅ Explore MASA API Search Dashboard: https://data.dev.masalabs.ai/dashboard  
- ✅ Test endpoint calls with Postman/cURL.

---

#### **Day 2: Real-Time Sentiment Scraper (Python)**
- ✅ Build Python service to:
  - Scrape crypto-related posts from X (Twitter/X API or scraping tool).
  - Use keyword filters (e.g., BTC, ETH, #Bitcoin, $SOL).
  - Process and store timestamped sentiment scores.
- ✅ Integrate MASA API for data enrichment (pull price trends or token metrics).
- ✅ Store data in local SQLite or Firestore for fast iteration.

---

#### **Day 3: MCP Integration & Context Layer**
- ✅ Create MCP client that:
  - Queries MASA's search endpoint.
  - Embeds MASA results as additional context for decision-making.
- ✅ Normalize context into usable format for the AI model.
- ✅ Start building basic `agent.py` for decision flow (sentiment + context → signal).

---

#### **Day 4: AI Agent (Signal Generation)**
- ✅ Build simple model or logic-based classifier:
  - Use rolling sentiment + MASA price context to trigger BUY/SELL/HOLD.
  - Options: LSTM, logistic regression, or rule-based scoring.
- ✅ Backtest strategy on 3–7 days of collected data.
- ✅ Store logs + signals to disk or DB.

---

#### **Day 5: Trading Engine + Simulation**
- ✅ Simulate crypto trades using a sandboxed exchange wrapper (CCXT, custom sim engine).
- ✅ Validate agent behavior (risk management, thresholds, stop-loss logic).
- ✅ Log simulated portfolio value over time.
- ✅ Begin planning UI wireframes in Figma or directly in code.

---

#### **Day 6: Frontend in Next.js**
- ✅ Create basic dashboard in Next.js:
  - Live sentiment feed.
  - Signal display (BUY/SELL/HOLD).
  - Portfolio simulation results.
  - Context explanation (from MCP/MASA).
- ✅ Use Tailwind + charts (e.g., Recharts or Chart.js).
- ✅ Connect backend API endpoints to frontend for live data.

---

#### **Day 7: Final Polish & Hosting**
- ✅ Set up deployment:
  - Python backend on Render, Railway, or fly.io.
  - Next.js frontend on Vercel.
- ✅ Add authentication or API key gating if needed.
- ✅ Final testing of end-to-end flow.
- ✅ Polish GitHub README and documentation.
- ✅ Record demo (screen recording) and prep for submission.

---

### 🎁 Deliverables by End of Week
- ✅ Fully functioning trading bot with real sentiment + MASA data
- ✅ MCP-enhanced decision logic
- ✅ Web dashboard in Next.js showing signals and trades
- ✅ Hosted backend and frontend
- ✅ GitHub repo with full documentation
- ✅ Optional: PDF slide deck for demo/competition judges
